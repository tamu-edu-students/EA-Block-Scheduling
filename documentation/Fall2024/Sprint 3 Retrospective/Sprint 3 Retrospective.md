By the end of this sprint, we will have fully developed admin and user dashboards, controllers to allow users the ability to login using single sign on, a completed page of available classes with their prerequisites, and a parser for excel documents.

**6. Sprint Backlog Items and Status**

1. *Block Generation Algorithm (which generates all possible blocks) <br>
          o	Refine the algorithm based on the feedback from client
          o	Blocker was to confirm from client whether we can ask students to let us know which 
          courses they have already completed. Hence, these items will be carried to next sprint
2. +Creating a database scheme <br>
          o	Schema and diagram are needed to have a clear idea how the tables are related to each other.
          Helps to have a better idea of data allocation. 
          Draft 1 is created but team decided to make some changes and hence new draft will 
          be released in next sprint.
